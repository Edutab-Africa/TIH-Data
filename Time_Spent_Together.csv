1,ETH001,"The mother was asked about what times when  her  children are together and replied as follows. Monday to Friday:  Since the two children (ETAM 002 & ETAY 003) attend school in the same shift, they spend most of their time together. But the oldest child (ETAS 004) attends school in opposite shift. Thus,  she interacts with her young  brother and sister in the morning, and evening times and spends little time with her youngsters during school days. Weekends: During the weekends, all the three children are at home.  The two children ( ETAM 002 & ETAY 003) spend most of their time together  throughout the day. However, the oldest child does not have much time to spend with her younger siblings. She is more responsible to help her mother.
